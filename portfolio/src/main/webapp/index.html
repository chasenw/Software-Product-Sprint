                Over the last year, I've become really interested in computer science. Although I did not come into college with the intention to major in it, 
                I have really enjoyed all of the introductory courses I have taken it (theory, probablity, and data structures), and I am excited to continue my 
                computer science career. Currently, I am familiar with python, C++, java, and I understand the concept of object oriented programming. I have also 
                taken an introductory online course on html, css, and javascript in web development, although I am still improving my skills

            I love sports, and I can watch basketball, tennis, soccer or football all day. I've also played tennis and basketball
            since I was young, and I still love to play both sports. I'm an avid fan of the Golden State Warriors and Philadelphia Eagles &#40doesn't make sense I know&#41, and I love
            to attend games when I can.

            Tutoring is something I'm passionate about and have done since high school. In 2019, I helped found an orginzation called
            StemUp STL which provided free tutoring to low income middle and high schoolers in the St. Louis area. In college, I started
            volunteering for a tutoring organization called EPATT
